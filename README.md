# CityU Sport Facility [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Aahung/cityu-sports.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Aahung/cityu-sports)
unofficial cityu sport facility booking app for iOS, [Android version here](https://github.com/Aahung/cityu-sports-android).

## Important Announcement

**On 07 Dec, 2015**. as a concern  sent from City University of Hong Kong:

> VPSA, Dean of Students and Director of SDS are concerning the security of
this kind of app because it's possible that the apps may store the username
and password and perform any action on behalf of any user in any of CityUâ€™s
Enterprise Systems.

My intention on this App is only to provide a better booking experience for CityU students and staffs. I have not done or tried to store any usernames or passwords or users. This project is competely open source and directly built then published without adding any lines of codes. 

However, to avoid any unhappiness likely to happen to me, I will no longer make **CityU Sport Facility** App available on App Store. I will also publish an update to disable the functions to App Store in the comming weeks. 
I am sorry for any inconvenience for current users. This project will be only for technical discussion from now on. 

**R.I.P.**
